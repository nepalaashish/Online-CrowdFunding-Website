# Online-CrowdFunding-Website
   This project is aiming to design a database-backed website for crowdfunding, similar to services such as Kickstarter or GoFundMe. Such services allow people to raise money for various activities, such as starting up a company, building a new product, creating a piece of art, or charitable causes. 
  More precisely, users should be able to post new projects for which money is requested, and other users can then pledge money towards these projects, and can also discuss and like projects. Moreover, once the project is funded and completed, users who gave money (sponsors) should be able to rate projects to express their satisfaction.

The website was deployed on [Heroku](https://vast-gorge-84703.herokuapp.com/) and the database instance was created on AWS.
